# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase build order following research recommendation -- shell first, injection second, blocking third, settings fourth
- [Roadmap]: BLOCK-03 (user-agent spoofing) placed in Phase 1 because Instagram requires it to function at all
- [Roadmap]: WKWebView config is immutable after init -- all architectural decisions must land in Phase 1
- [Phase 01]: Removed deprecated WKProcessPool -- iOS 17+ shares process pool by default (D-03 satisfied)
- [Phase 01]: Added @MainActor to DataStoreManager for Swift 6 strict concurrency with WKWebsiteDataStore
- [Phase 01]: Used async decidePolicyFor variant for Swift 6 strict concurrency
- [Phase 01]: Auth modal shares platform WKWebsiteDataStore so login cookies persist correctly

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 01.1 inserted after Phase 1: Native Shell Polish (INSERTED) — floating navigation button, home screen, custom loading screens, auth modal as half-sheet, background blending groundwork

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
